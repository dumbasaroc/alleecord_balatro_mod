## How to install

<b>First, ensure that you have Lovely and Steamodded installed. You can find both of these projects here:</b>
- [Lovely Injector](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector)
- [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods)

1. Download the most recent release of the Alleecord Community Mod from the [releases page](https://github.com/dumbasaroc/alleecord_balatro_mod/releases/latest).
2. Unzip the folder.
3. Move the `AlleecordMod` folder to the `Mods` folder of your Balatro installation. The location of this should be:
    - **Windows**: `C:/Users/<your user>/AppData/Roaming/Balatro/Mods` (just pasting `%AppData%/Balatro/Mods` into Windows Explorer should suffice.)
    - **Linux/Proton**: `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/2379780/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Roaming/Balatro/Mods`
    - **MacOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Balatro/Mods`
4. Start playing! You should be all set, provided Steamodded and Lovely are installed correctly!
